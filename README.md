The UI of a Java calculator can be themed dark by using a dark color palette for the background and text elements. The theme should also include a dark color for the buttons, as well as an appropriate font and font size. Additionally, the calculator should be designed to be easy-to-use and intuitive with an overall aesthetic that is consistent with the overall dark theme.
