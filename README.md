This is the first version of a basic Java calculator. The program is designed to allow a user to perform basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is written in Java and uses a basic GUI interface. The user is able to enter two numbers and select the type of operation they would like to perform. The program then calculates the result and displays it on the screen. 

This version of the calculator is very basic and does not include any advanced features such as memory or scientific operations. It is designed to be a simple and easy to use program for basic calculations. 

The program is designed to be easy to use and understand. There are no complicated menus or options to navigate. The user simply enters the two numbers they wish to use and selects the type of operation they would like to perform. The program then calculates the result and displays it on the screen. 

The program is designed to be robust and reliable. It has been tested extensively. If you encounter any problems or bugs, please let us know so that we can fix them. 

This version of the calculator is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn about Java programming. It is a basic program that is easy to understand and modify. We hope you enjoy using it and that it helps you learn more about Java programming.

## Getting Started

### Interface

The UI of a Java calculator can be themed dark by using a dark color palette for the background and text elements. The theme should also include a dark color for the buttons, as well as an appropriate font and font size. Additionally, the calculator should be designed to be easy-to-use and intuitive with an overall aesthetic that is consistent with the overall dark theme.
